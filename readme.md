##Contents
1. Farm-model: contains code and data for fitting the temporal dynamics of outbreak and control to counts of sea lice from three salmon farms in the Broughton Archipelago.

2. Larval-distribution: code to simulate the distribution of infectious sea lice in space and time from the temporal dynamics on farms.  This distribution is then outputted, and used in fitting additional parameters for the infection dynamics on migrating juvenile salmon.

3. Fitting: code and data for fitting the infection dynamics on migrating juvenile salmon.

4. Simulations: code that uses the fitted model parameters to explore different treatment scenarios.

### Disclaimer: the code is not perfectly commented...please email me if you somehow stumble upon this repository and are interested in applying our model.
